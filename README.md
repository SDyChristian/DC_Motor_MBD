## Electro-Mechanical Dynamic Model

![DC Motor Diagram](Images/Dc_Motor_Diagram.PNG)

The dynamic model of the DC motor was built using components from the Simscape library. 
- The parameters assigned to each component correspond to real-world systems: the BALDOR AP233001 DC motor and the IRF640 MOSFET.
- Sensors are assumed to be ideal for the purposes of these simulations.
